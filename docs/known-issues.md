# Known Issues

* Swift not implemented
* Exception propagation not fully supported (especially in JavaScript)
* Does not correctly detect missing `:async` and `:context` errors yet
* No support for tail-recursion yet
* I would like a `(func for)`, `(func for-async)` similar to `(func let)`, `(func let-async)`
* Replace refcounts with Atomic if multithreading
