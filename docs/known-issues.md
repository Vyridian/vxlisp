# Known Issues

* Swift not implemented
* Exception propagation not fully supported (especially in JavaScript)
* Does not correctly detect missing :async and :context errors yet
* No support for tail-recursion yet
* I would like a (func for), (func for-async) similar to (func let), (func let-async)
